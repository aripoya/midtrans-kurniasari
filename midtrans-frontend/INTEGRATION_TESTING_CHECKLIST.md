## üß™ Integration Test Scenarios

### 1. Admin Role - Complete Workflow ‚úÖ
**Login & Authentication**
- [ ] Admin login with correct credentials
- [ ] JWT token properly stored and used for API calls
- [ ] Admin dashboard loads with order statistics
- [ ] Real-time sync status indicator shows "connected"

**Order Management**
- [ ] View all orders in AdminOrdersPage
- [ ] Navigate to order detail page for specific order
- [ ] Update order shipping status
- [ ] Update order shipping area (dalam kota ‚Üî luar kota)
- [ ] Add admin notes to orders

**Photo Upload & Display**
- [ ] Upload shipping images via AdminOrderDetailPage
- [ ] Verify images are stored with correct URLs (not base64)
- [ ] View uploaded images immediately after upload
- [ ] Verify images persist after page refresh

**Real-Time Updates**
- [ ] Changes made by admin reflect in outlet/delivery dashboards
- [ ] Real-time sync indicator shows last update timestamp
- [ ] Manual refresh button works correctly

### 2. Outlet Role - Complete Workflow ‚úÖ
**Login & Authentication**
- [ ] Outlet login with correct credentials (e.g., 'outlet_bonbin')
- [ ] JWT token authentication for outlet API calls
- [ ] OutletDashboard loads with assigned orders only
- [ ] Real-time sync shows outlet-specific updates

**Order Processing**
- [ ] View orders assigned to specific outlet location
- [ ] Open "Status Foto" modal for eligible orders
- [ ] Upload photos for different stages (readyForPickup, pickedUp, delivered)
- [ ] Update shipping status via dropdown

**Photo Upload Integration**
- [ ] Upload photos using modern adminApi.uploadShippingImage() endpoint
- [ ] Verify photo URLs are returned and displayed correctly
- [ ] Photos uploaded by outlet visible in admin dashboard
- [ ] No page reloads - uses fetchOrders() for updates

**Cross-Role Sync**
- [ ] Photos uploaded by outlet visible to admin immediately
- [ ] Status updates by outlet trigger real-time sync to admin
- [ ] Order assignments by admin appear in outlet dashboard

### 3. Delivery Role - Complete Workflow ‚úÖ
**Login & Authentication**
- [ ] Deliveryman login with credentials ('delivery'/'delivery123')
- [ ] DeliveryDashboard loads with assigned orders only
- [ ] JWT authentication works for delivery endpoints

**Order Processing**
- [ ] View orders assigned via assigned_deliveryman_id
- [ ] Navigate to order detail pages
- [ ] Update shipping status to "Dalam Pengiriman" or "Diterima"
- [ ] Upload photos for delivery confirmation

**Photo Upload & Status Updates**
- [ ] Upload photos via OrderDetailPage using standardized API
- [ ] Verify delivery photo uploads work with Cloudflare Images
- [ ] Status updates restricted to allowed values only
- [ ] Real-time sync propagates delivery updates to admin/outlet

**Integration with Other Roles**
- [ ] Delivery updates visible in admin dashboard immediately
- [ ] Photos uploaded by delivery visible to admin and outlet
- [ ] Assignment changes by admin appear in delivery dashboard

### 4. Public/Consumer Role - Read-Only Validation ‚úÖ
**Order Status Viewing**
- [ ] Access public order detail via `/order/:id` URL
- [ ] View order information without authentication
- [ ] See uploaded photos from all roles (admin, outlet, delivery)
- [ ] Real-time sync shows latest order status

**Photo Display Logic**
- [ ] Luar Kota orders show only 1 photo slot ("Foto Diterima")
- [ ] Dalam Kota orders show 3 photo slots
- [ ] Photos display with correct URLs (not broken links)
- [ ] ShippingImageDisplay component works consistently

## üîÑ Cross-Role Integration Tests

### Photo Upload Pipeline End-to-End
1. **Admin uploads** shipping photo ‚Üí **Outlet sees** photo ‚Üí **Delivery sees** photo ‚Üí **Public sees** photo
2. **Outlet uploads** status photos ‚Üí **Admin sees** photos ‚Üí **Delivery sees** photos ‚Üí **Public sees** photos  
3. **Delivery uploads** confirmation photo ‚Üí **Admin sees** photo ‚Üí **Outlet sees** photo ‚Üí **Public sees** photo

### Real-Time Synchronization Validation
1. **Admin updates** order status ‚Üí **Outlet dashboard** updates ‚Üí **Delivery dashboard** updates
2. **Outlet changes** status ‚Üí **Admin panel** updates ‚Üí **Delivery view** updates
3. **Delivery confirms** receipt ‚Üí **Admin panel** updates ‚Üí **Outlet dashboard** updates ‚Üí **Public page** updates

### Authentication & RBAC Verification
1. **Admin** can access all functions, see all orders, modify everything
2. **Outlet** can only see assigned orders, upload photos, update status for their orders
3. **Delivery** can only see assigned orders, upload confirmation photos, mark as delivered
4. **Public** can only view order status, no modifications allowed
